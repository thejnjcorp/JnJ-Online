# JnJ Rules:


# Introduction:

JnJ is a TTRPG system that has loose roots in DnD 5e and strong roots in Pathfinder 2e. Like DnD and Pathfinder, JnJ has a level up system with subclasses and character archetypes as well as a stat point sheet and dice rolling. More information about the subtleties will be covered in the **Combat **and **Character sheet **sections of this ruleset. JnJ has a unique method of looking at combat with its **Tempo System** that, at a lower tempo, is experienced purely with theater of the mind while higher tempos are more similar to its DnD and Pathfinder roots using a traditional map system for combat. JnJ has designed a unique skill and flaw system that characterizes characters personalities for a variety of use cases ranging from roleplay to interacting with the environment. This system replaces the skill system used in DnD and Pathfinder and is less restrictive and more open to interpretation (although said interpretation is to be agreed upon by both the Game Master/Director (GM/D) and the player upon creation). Like DnD and Pathfinder, the GM/D’s word is law in JnJ. As common etiquette at most TTRPG tables, criticism and feedback is to be given after a session. 


## How To Play:

The JnJ system is a variation of a TTRPG where creativity is everything. JnJ is a collaborative game where all parties involved help to drive and narrate a given story. By doing this you must create characters that will fit and dive in head first into the story. But remember, the biggest thing is that creativity needs to be on 24/7 as being creative will open up whole new scenarios. The rules of the system are pretty straight forward especially since the way everything is written in the ruleset is literally what it means. The ruleset is made to ensure that anyone can read and understand the rules. Another aspect of this system is that a lot of the system can be modified. The way we intended to make the system was that a GM can take the system and modify some of the rules, classes, etc… that would best fit their plan for their way of play and setting of their campaign. That's why many things in the system can be switched out, modified, or just gotten rid of. The biggest part is that you come to the game and table with an open mind as if you have a closed mind, it will ruin the experience for all parties involved.


## Roles: 

Like all TTRPG, there are 2 roles that are needed for a campaign. The two roles are the GM and the players. 

The GM:

The GM(Game Master) acts as the storyteller, Narrator, and the referee of the story and what players can and cannot do. Being a GM means that you will prepare an adventure for the players, you will need to narrate the story, come up with unique and engaging scenarios for the players, make Non playable characters(NPCs) that feel unique that the players can interact with, and depending on the type of campaign and story you want to build, come up and build combat encounters for the party. It is the Games job to build the outline of the story and help guide your players throughout the story. As a GM, a very important factor that is important is you are NOT playing against the players. Yes, you can make it difficult for the players but you should not be actively trying to have the party die as soon as possible. 


## The Players:

The players are the other side of the coin. Where GMs build and give the outline of the story, the players guide and fill in the blanks for a story. As a player, you(along with your GM) will come up with many concepts for a character that has skills, flaws, backstory, and specific actions that you find the most equipped for what you want. Once you make your character, it is your job to take this character and play the character accurately. Note. The more time and info you put into your character, the more profitable the GM can make for any story that has to do with a character. Being a player, you will be tasked with role playing your character. For some this might just be using different word diction to portray how a character talks. For others, this will be speaking in a different accent and tone of voice that is not normal for the player. As a player, you will also be challenged through many ways of combat, hard consequential decisions, team/party communication, and having trust in your GMs. Players must NOT think that the GMs are against them. When there is no trust in your GM is when the campaign can start to slip. 


### Basic Tools needed:

The basic tools that are needed are very simple and will be very easy to obtain. To be able to have a great time while playing these are some of the items that you need. For starters, having a copy of this rule sheet is needed. Everything you need to know and learn as a player and as a GM are all listed throughout the rule sheet. You will also need one of the JnJ character sheets. There are two character sheets. One of the sheets is a printable sheet that is a condensed and simplified sheet that you can print out. The other is a sheet that is an excel that will give you the full JnJ character sheet experience. Just like every TTRPG, you need a set of dice. A set of dice you would need are D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, and a D100. It’s also recommended but optional to have a few sets of dice as you may need multiple of a certain dice. You need bodies. You need 1 person to GM and for best play at least 3 people to be players. Without people to play with, you will not be able to play. Some Optional items you may want are pencils, sheets of paper to take notes, figurines of characters, GM screen, maps, whiteboards, and markers. **“For new/beginner players, it is recommended to have a copy of the JnJ cheat sheet.”** If you are using all paper and not using a computer, it’s recommended to have some folder that has everything you need.  The last thing you need to have is an open mind. Coming to the table with an open mind will open up your journey to a whole new world and ultimately will enhance your pleasure and time while you play. 


## History:

JnJ was created by a group of friends looking to get more value out of DnD 5e after facing rampant min/maxing and general GM toxicity. After moving to Pathfinder 2e for a better combat experience the group noticed a lack of flexibility in the system afforded by DnD as well as a long list of rules that made rule lawyers rampant, building upon the toxicity. After seeing the writing on the wall, a new system was drawn up and designed with limiting the root of the toxicity in mind: player and GM communication. As a result, JnJ was created with a combat system similar to Pathfinder 2e and a heavy character/class creation that requires communication with both the Game Master/Director (GM/D) and the player to establish both what the player wants to do as well as the rules by which the character is to be played. Combat was later amended as theater of the mind was found to have much faster and immersive combat compared to traditional grid system combat that increased player involvement and decreased time spent per round of combat. We hope you have as much fun playing JnJ as we did both creating and playing it. To many happy sessions: \

# World Mechanics:


## Conditions/Statuses:


### Exhaustion:

**huff* hang on, lemme take a quick break, *huff* I think I just need to lie down for a bit.*

With each point of exhaustion, your condition worsens. Exhaustion 1 decreases your AC, hit modifiers, and class stats by 1. If a DC or hit modifier exists for this stat, these values are reduced. Exhaustion 2 decreases your core and campaign stats by 1. Exhaustion 3 decreases AC, hit modifiers, core stats, and the campaign stat by 2. Exhaustion 4 and 5 both decrease AC, hit modifiers, core stats, and the campaign stat by 4 and 6, respectively. Exhaustion 6 decreases AC, hit modifiers, core stats, and the campaign stat by 9. Anything after Exhaustion 6 is something deadly the Game Master/Director decides (Death itself is an option).

### Hardness:

*For some, failing to dodge an attack might be the end of them, yet whether it be the armor you wear,or the scar tissue on your body, your hardness shall protect you. *

When being attacked, subtract the amount of hardness you have to the damage being dealt and take that damage instead. For example, you are taking total damage of 10, yet you have hardness 2, so subtract 10 by 2 and take 8 damage.


### Resistance: 

*The difference between boys and men. Boys get burned. Men pub walk through the explosions. After all, cool guys don’t look at explosions.*

You are resistant to a specific type of damage. Resistance applies after damage calculation (including critical hits). Resistances can stack. For example, you take 4 normal damage, 3 fire damage, and 2 lightning damage with Fire 5 and Lightning 5 resistances. To calculate the damage with resistances, you subtract 3 by 5 to the fire damage and subtract 2 by 5 to the lightning damage (you do not go into negatives).

If a resistance is applied to someone with weakness, they will negate based on the number. Example with weakness: applying a fire resistance of 2 on someone with weakness fire 5, now has fire weakness 3. The GM always has the power to overrule otherwise.


### Immunity:

*These fools have no common sense, they think the tools they wield will bring them safety and valor. Yet none of them know… They have come unprepared against me.*

You do not take that type of damage.

Immunity always takes precedence over weakness. The GM also has the power to overrule otherwise.


### Weakness:

*I may be strong, I may be tough, I may be fast, but that water spell, it scares me half to death. Literally.*

You are weak to a specific type of damage. Weakness applies after damage calculation (including critical hits). Weaknesses can stack. For example, you take 4 normal damage, 3 fire damage, and 2 lightning damage with Fire 5 and Lightning 5 weakness. To calculate the damage with resistances, you add 5 to 3 from the fire damage and add 5 to 2 from the lightning damage.

If a weakness is applied to someone with resistance, they will negate based on the number. Example with resistance: applying a fire weakness of 5 on someone with resistance fire 2, now has fire weakness 3. The GM always has the power to overrule otherwise.

Immunity always takes precedence over weakness. The GM also has the power to overrule otherwise.


### Stunned:

*You are now slowed, but worse. Have fun doing nothing! :)*

Stunned speechless, you have difficulty moving. Lose the amount of actions based on the number of stunned you have. Stunned 1 loses one action, Stunned 2 loses 2 actions, etc. Remove stun by the number of turns lost. Stunned over 3 will carry over to the next turn. For example, someone with stun 4 would lose their entire turn and then 1 action next turn. 

Sleep:

*Zzzzzzzzzz*

It's bedtime now, You fall asleep standing. If someone does not actively try to wake you up before it's too late, your entire turn will be skipped. Getting woken up might require different things, slapping someone awake might not always work. 


### Adrenalized: 

*Get back up, your journey is not over yet. Get back to the front line and risk your life or leave a coward!*

Adrenaline flowing through your veins, you feel more energized. When Adrenalized, you restore 1 HP and must immediately take a very specific action and gain 10 temporary HP. This action allows you to either readrenalize yourself or move away. When your turn starts and you did not readrenalize yourself, you lose the 10 temporary HP. Take your actions as you would regularly.


### Slowed:

*The world isn’t in slow motion, you’re just slow. Oh yeah, you also can’t do much either. :/*

Lose a single action for a certain number of rounds. For example, Slowed 2 means you lose 1 action on turn 1 then Slowed 2 goes to Slowed 1, and then you lose another action turn 2 and remove slowed. 


### Haste:

*Actions go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!*

Gain a single action for a certain number of rounds. For example, Haste 2 means you gain 1 action on turn 1 then Haste 2 goes to Haste 1, and then you gain another action turn 2 and remove haste. 


### Covered:

*What!? Did you think I would just stand in the middle of nothing and dodge?? Who the hell waits to get shot!?*

Gain 1 AC against ranged attacks, and moving causes you to lose covered. You may then spend an action while covered to turn Non-visible.


### Non-visible:

*Now you see me, now you don’t, sucker!*

Gain 2 AC against ranged attacks. Attacking causes you to lose Non-visible. If you were Non-visible due to taking the Cover action previously, regain Covered.


### Hidden:

*Those who aimlessly walk without checking their surroundings, are nothing but prey for the hunters that stalk. Patience is simply the cost for success. *

All ranged attacks against you have a 25% chance to miss. Roll a d4. On a 1, the attack misses. All attacks from the Hidden person will have a degree success higher on all hit rolls and loses Hidden after. Hidden is rarely given during combat after a person has been seen.


### Encircled:

*Come out with your hands up, we have you surrounded!*

The party of lower individuals in engagement loses 2 AC against all attacks from the higher individual party. With a party of 2 and a party of 3 in engagement, all members in the party of 2 will lose 2 AC on all attacks from the party of 3.


### Engaged:

*Congratulations!*

You focus on a target, creating a **Zipper** bubble around all those currently engaged, activating any engagement effects and reactions. 


### Dying:

*Even while down, you find yourself forced to keep on fighting for your life. No matter what or who you see in this state, you must keep your focus, and push on for your life. *

When a player’s health becomes 0, they are now considered dying. While dying on the player's turn, instead of taking their actions normally, they will now roll to see if they will be getting back up or making a new character. Think of dying like a tug of war with death himself. Start the player’s dying number based on Wounded # + 1. For example, if they never went down, they would have wounded 0+1. The player must now roll a D20 with no modifiers. On a 11 or higher, the player wins a round with death and reduces his dying # by 1. On a 10 or lower, they start to lose and increase their dying count by 1. When their dying # is 0, they have staved off death enough to be safe. Set their HP to 1 but give them the unconscious condition. If their Dying ever reaches 4, give them the death they deserve. If the player rolls a natural 1 while in their tug of war with death, they will increase their dying # by 2. If the player rolls a natural 20, they win their battle, and immediately get back up with their HP set to 1 and are given back their 3 actions to fight (Still gaining their deserved wounded)! A player also gets back up from dying whenever they receive healing. A player may also decide before they roll their death save to spend **ALL **available **Hero Points** to save themselves. There are special rules for this depending on the amount of hero points used. 


### Wounded:

*My missing arm? It’s just a flesh wound, not a big deal.*

Whenever someone succeeds from their tug of war with death and gets back up from dying, they are given a stack of wounded. If a player goes down, and then gets healed back up, they have Wounded 1, if they go back down, healed again, they now have Wounded 2. All stacks of Wounded go away after a short rest or long rest. 


### Frightened:

*Rawr! Did I scare you?*

Gives a minus 1 to all checks and hit rolls, increasing with each frightened stack. Frightened will go down every time the inflicted person starts their turn unless specified otherwise. A target with Frightened 2 will have a minus 2 for all checks and rolls before their first turn, and a minus 1 before their second turn. When their second turn starts, they lose Frightened.


### Blind:

*Opening and closing your eyes does nothing as all you see is a vast emptiness, I guess this is a good opportunity to see just how much you truly need your sight. *

You become unable to use sight to perceive the locations of enemies and items. You automatically critically fail any check that requires vision and you’re immune to all vision effects. If you are engaged in combat you can still make melee/ranged attacks with a 50% (2 or below on a d4) chance to miss against those you’re engaged with, and a 25%(1 on a d4) chance to miss if you are attacking back due to Zipper. Any ranged attack outside of engagement will have a 75% (3 or below on a d4) chance to miss its target. Attacking someone outside of your zone will have a 83.5% (rolling a 5 or below on a d6) chance to miss. These odds can be better or worse depending on the scenario and the Character/Class being used. AOE ranged attack odds are to be set by the GM.


### Deafened:

*The last thing you hear is a loud sharp ring blast in your ears followed by nothing, as people and objects continue to animate without sound. *

You are unable to hear any sound around you. You automatically critically fail any check that requires hearing and you are immune to all effects that require your auditory sense.


### Dismembered: 

*Jerry, why is my right foot across the room?*

While dismembered, any action that requires both of the same limb, is a critical fail. Any item that has been held by a dismembered limb will be dropped. Basic healing does not remove dismemberment.


### Encumbered:

*With every step that you take, you feel your knees buckle, your speed slowed down as if you were the same speed as a sloth as you are carrying a massively packed bag on your back.*

While moving, you move slowly because of the weight that you are carrying. In combat while encumbered, it takes 2+ actions to move one zone. All mobility saves rolled while encumbered will suffer one degree of success lower. 


### Fleeing: 

*As you look at the field, you realize that you want to get the heck out of here. They scare you.*

Using all 3 actions, you flee combat and get as far away as you can. If you are being intimidated, you get a one degree success higher.


### Drained:


### Immobilized:

*As you try to move, you realize you aren't going anywhere*

You are immobilized, and you can't take any movement actions into any other zones including disengage and intercept. You also have a degree of success lower on Reflex check.


### Grappled:

*As you look, you see that something or someone has a hold of you*

While you are grappled, you have a -2 to your AC only for the grappler.


### Restrained:

*These handcuffs are a little too tight, would you mind loosening them.*

Being restrained by cuffs, vines, etc… While restrained, you may move normally but are not able to do actions that involve any part of the body that is restrained. 


### Surprised: 

*Oh my, you startled me, I did not see you there kind sir.*


### Paralyzed:

*………*

Being paralyzed, you cannot move, speak, or do anything. The only thing you can do is see and think. In combat, all your actions are limited to seeing, thinking, or analyzing whatever that does not involve speaking or moving. While Paralyzed you auto fail Reflex checks.


### Prone:

*I’m just tired and taking a nap. Don’t wake me up, I’ll get up eventually.*

You take a minus 2 AC penalty for all melee attack rolls against you. You can take an action to stand up to end the condition. You can also take cover to give yourself a plus 4 AC against all ranged attacks.


### Unconscious:

*ZZZzzzzz me me me me ZZZZzzzzz me me me me*

You are in a prone condition, unconscious and have no actions.


### Doomed:

*Hey, what’s that? Wait, no, wait, stop no! I can’t die tod–*


### Silenced:

*Hmmmm! Mhmh Mhmh! Mmhmhmhmh!*

When silenced, you are unable to the speak and cast spells if those spells would be vocal.


### Confused:

*Ahh ohh! Wh–Where am I?*

You don’t know where you are and are unable to recognize those around you. In combat, you have to make a DC save to avoid attacking someone or something at random. On a success, nothing happens. On a fail, you roll a dice to see who or what you attack.


### Persistent Damage:

*What flavor of ice cream do I want to screw over the party today?*

Each turn, make a DC save to avoid persistent damage. If you fail, each round you must take damage equal to the level of the damage type. Damage type # = amount of damage each turn. If you save the dc check, you avoid the damage. 


#### Bleeding:

*Help, I'm bleeding out, someone get me a bandage.*

Check Persistant Damage above.


#### Burning:

*Help me, somebody grab me a bucket of water before my clothes burn off.*


#### Melting:

*Help me, I'm melting, melting, ooh what a world, what a world.*


#### Poisoned:

*With every thought in your head, you get more and more sick as if someone fed you some rat poisoning.*


#### Frostburn:

*Every few seconds, you can see your arms and skin turn a nasty blue purple.*


#### Suffocating:

*As every single second passes by, the more and more you can't breathe as you ponder, was that my last breath of air I took. *


## Core Stats:


## Campaign Stat:


## Armor Class (AC):

How well you can dodge or block (your choice). Compared against an attacking hit roll, where an equal or higher roll means a hit and lower means a miss/dodge/block. AC can be changed due to conditions and statuses, and your AC is determined by your class AC.


## Health Points (HP):

The amount of health your character has. This can be calculated by your class base HP times 2 plus the amount of strength you have. Once your health is reduced down to 0, you gain the Dying condition, and start rolling death saves.


## Healing and the Philosophy: 

Unlike other systems healing is not locked to class instead healing is given out by the GM/D to a character or multiple. This is to prevent having someone needing to pick a healing class and can pick a class they want to play. Don’t Worry if you still want to be the healer as you can ask the designated healer. The standard for a normal party is to have one character with 3/day 1d10+4 hp If a party member is 1 zone away, you can give it to them to bring them back up. Recovery for healing works Slightly Different then other limited Abilities. Upon taking a short rest you gain 1 use back In addition you can use your recovery slot to gain an additional use back for a total of 2.


## Ability Checks:

Ability checks are rolls to see if a character gets affected or dodges an effect. Standard DC save indicates that a success will give half damage while a failed check will give full damage. Additionally, critical successes and failures may give additional effects depending on spell effects. If a spell or attack does not have Standard DC saves, then it is a hit or miss depending on success or failure, and skills will note what happens for each type of roll. If the GM/D asks players to roll a DC, then the GM/D will determine the effects for each roll. The type of roll will be determined by the **Core Stats**. If Dexterity is a stat, then a Standard Dexterity DC save will add the modifier listed in the character’s Dexterity stat.


### Success, Failure, and Critical Rolls

When rolling against or for anything, there is a number that you roll against. Players will roll a number and add their modifiers if applicable. On ties, the person who rolls will always win with no exceptions. Success rolls are rolls that are equal or above the number they are rolling against. Failure rolls are rolls that are below the number they are rolling against. Critical rolls are numbers that are 10 above or below the number they are rolling against. For example, a check of 16 means that a player needs to roll 16 or above to succeed. A roll of 14 is a failure, a roll of 18 is a success, a roll of 26 is a critical success, and a roll of 6 is a critical failure.


## Hero Points:

Everyone is a hero in a campaign, but sometimes even heroes need a Deus ex Machina moment. Now introducing: Hero Points. All players start each session with one hero point, and can be given hero points from the GM/D for good roleplay. Additionally, one hero point can be given out to one player every hour by the GM/D. Hero points can also be given when a player rolls a natural 1 on any d20 roll or if a player rolls the same number after using a hero point. A hero point rolled in this way cannot be used until the next roll. Hero points allow you to reroll any die the player wants, such as that one natural one on an important save or the difference between hitting and missing on a big attack. Note that hero points are non-transferable, meaning that if another player made a bad decision on what they used their hero point on, they cannot be bailed by another player.

Besides rerolling a die, hero points can also save you from dying. When you roll death saves and are on dying 3, fail the roll, and are about to die, you will consume all hero points to stabilize yourself. If you have one hero point, you automatically stabilize. If you have two hero points, roll a d20 and on a 11 or higher you get up with 1 HP, otherwise you stabilize. If you have three hero points, you automatically get up with 1 HP. At the end of a session, all hero points are reset to one for the next session.


## Crafting: 


## Clocks:


## Inventory:


## Money:

*Do you have money? No??? Well sucks to be you!*

The JnJ system can be modularized for your world and campaign depending on your world currency such as copper, silver, gold, and platinum. If you want to use cash and checks in a more modern scenario, nothing is stopping you. For the former, we recommend a silver economy to make gold and platinum have a much stronger sense of value and worth. We also recommend that you start your players with a fair amount of money for their characters they designed and allow them ways to make money fairly. We surely don't want a massive story to end just because our party can't afford to adventure anymore! 


## Long Rest: 

First, it must be safe enough to take a long rest which is determined by the GM/D. Then, a long rest takes 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. All participants will heal to full HP and recover all limited and ultimate actions. In addition, they remove one exhaustion point. If you do not take a long rest once every 24 hours, gain one point of exhaustion every 24 hours.


### Morning Routine:

At the beginning of the day you start your morning routine which may encompass making a meal, Forging, Crafting, or any other character abilities that might trigger.


### Nightly Routine:

At the beginning of the night you start your nightly routine which may encompass making a meal, Forging, Crafting or any other character abilities that might trigger.


### Short Rest: 

Upon taking a short rest all Participants will heal half their hp and may choose to remove one level of exhaustion or gain one use back of a limited action. In addition, players are encouraged to roleplay using/doing their skills and hobbies. Over time, doing this along with a campaign event (which is determined by the GM/D) can allow a player to change a skill or gain a new one.


# Player Guide: 

When starting as a player in the JnJ system, it might seem overwhelming how loose everything is, and you might even be worried about the amount of trust you must allocate into your Game Master/Director (GM/D). I would advise you to pick someone to run this system that you can either trust fully with your character or plan to grow together and improve together in a healthy relationship. JnJ gives the benefit of being able to fully design your own unique character and have the system do its best to accommodate you and your needs instead of bending your character into a class mold that honestly just doesn't fit. Unlike DnD where you first roll your characters stats to decide what type of character you want to create, we first must decide what type of campaign everyone wants to do. 


## Campaign Philosophy: 

Starting a campaign is fun and exciting, and there are just so many possible ideas and desires we want to try out. However, we must first sit together and talk about what we all want to do and why we want to do it. First, we recommend a party size of 3 to 5 players for a single GM/D campaign. This is the amount of players we feel is just right for everyone to get enough screen time and feel included. Next, we must decide on our expectations for the campaign. Are we expecting a casual game full of laughs and chill times where we’re eating pizza while another friend is planning their actions, or are we expecting a serious and gritty story where we’re sitting at the edge of our seats intensely watching our friend perfectly roleplay their turn in a beautiful sight to view. The GM/D should not be considered an equal vote to the players, and we should respect the story they want to spend hours creating and pumping with their love and passion. However, we should not force ourselves to do a campaign players don't want to play in. This should be a negotiation between everyone at the table and make sure to voice your opinions during it or forever deal with the consequences of staying silent. Once the campaign tone and general story has been decided on, we can move on to character creation. Remember, we should try to create a character that can fit into the campaign. If the GM/D is following the recommended campaign creation process, they should be building 50-75% of the campaign story without the party in mind, and then coming back to the party to make their characters in the world so they can then build around said characters. However, make sure that the world building and story is significant to the players as well. The easiest way to think about this is to try removing the player characters from the story. Will the story turn out the same way without the players? If yes, then try incorporating more character elements that make the story significant to the players. Try to remember that if the GM/D is expecting a story on par to JRR Tolkien, don't add in Bugs Bunny as one of the characters. 


## Character/Class Creation:

Character creation in JnJ is directly linked with class creation, as each player’s character class is designed with both the character and what the player wants to do in combat in mind. With that in mind, here is the basic layout for a character sheet:



The character sheet has scripts to make the play experience easier that need to be enabled upon each duplication of the sheet. The first thing of importance to highlight are the GM and Class columns, which show stats that will define both your character and their abilities in the JnJ system. The GM stats will be predetermined before the start of your adventure. The stats are the same across the board for all the players. Some examples include Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Charisma, Wisdom, etc. Your GM will choose four stats that can be implemented the best to insure the maximization of your fun. When it comes to the four stats, there are two different arrays that you can distribute the modifiers. You can distribute them as +4,+3,+2, and +1 or +3, +3, +2, +2. These arrays do NOT have to be followed by every player in the campaign as you can have 1 person in a 4 person party use the “1-4” array and 3 people use the “2,3” array and vice versa.

Alongside the four GM stats, we move to the class stats. The class stats will include, Melee hit, Ranged hit, Specialized stat(If applicable), and Ammo. All four of these class stats can, and sometimes will, be a different value than other players. The value will be determined by the GM. 

Melee hit is the stat that is used when you make a melee attack check. After the melee attack roll, you add whatever the modifier the melee hit stat is to the end result of the roll. Ex. Let's say that you roll your d20 and roll a 14. After that you would add your melee hit modifier. When you look at your melee hit, it is a +4. You go back to your 14 that you just rolled and add the +4 to the 14, making the total 18.Ranged hit is the exact same as the melee hit but, instead, it is used whenever you use a ranged weapon (Ex. Bow, Gun, Slingshot, etc.). The Specialized stat is a stat that would come as an extra stat per the GM’s liking. Last for the class stats is Ammo. This will just show how many arrows or any form of ammunition that you have available.

Next up is the Campaign stat. The campaign stat can be the same across the board, but ultimately can be subject to change if it would make sense for what the GM is running. The stat can be anything that the GM thinks makes sense for the setting of the campaign. If you are set in a wizard world, it might be Arcana or Magic. If you are set in a medieval knights’ round table world, it might be Swordsmanship. It is all up to the GM and when/where the journey will take place. Not only can it be the same stat, but it can also be the same modifier across the board.


### ArcheTypes:

The JnJ system decides to group up our classes in what we feel are proper umbrella groups for them. This is to better give those who want to use them a greater understanding of what they’re getting themselves into without having to do a deep dive into the class. We currently have 4 ArchTypes and have organized our classes into what we feel best describes them. If you want to create your own class, try and use the ArchType to better describe the feeling and playstyle of what you’re trying to create. Remember, some classes should be better or worse than others, and it's perfectly fine if they borrow some abilities from each other as long as what makes them unique is apparent. Players should try to balance their party compositions with a healthy mix of ArcheTypes so that everyone will feel different from each other and can do their own unique thing. We haven't had enough play testing to be able to try every single combination of classes, so please remember that this isn't designed with min-maxers in mind. Try and have some fun without breaking the game!


#### Attrionists:

Attrionists are designed to be consistent and balanced damage focused classes. These are usually best suited for less experienced players or those that want simpler mechanics so they focus much more on better roleplay. You should be expecting a playstyle that is honest and easy to understand while still having the options to make big swings during combat. Lots of times, you will be face to face with an enemy while you strike them down with your attacks.

Classes under the Attrionists Archetype include; Magus, Duelist, Distorsinist, and Deadly duo.


#### Crit Hunters:

Crit Hunters are designed to hit critical hits more often, dealing loads of damage. The cost is when you do not crit, dealing laughably low amounts of damage. It is gambling at its finest! Why do 10 damage on 3 separate turns when you can do 30 in 1. Crit Hunters are best suited for players that are able to think more complex than simplistic.  While playing a Crit Hunter, you should expect a playstyle where not every single turn you are going to be doing good damage, but every once and awhile you can deal the highest damage in the party.

Classes under the Crit Hunter Archetype include: Gunslinger and Monk.


#### Manipulators: 

Manipulators are designed to be able to turn the battle using more utility based actions, such as enhancing allies or weakening enemies. Manipulators are best suited for players that understand mechanics and are willing to play at a difficult level of play. While playing a Manipulator, you should expect gameplay where you will be buffing your allies, defuffing your enemies, and crowd controlling. This can be healing, giving enemies a -1 to hit, or giving allies +1 to hit.

Classes under the Manipulator Archetype include: Bartender, Crusader Tank, Investigator, and Death Keeper.


#### Snowballers:

Snowballers are designed to be not very useful at the start of the combat, but the longer combat is held, the more useful and stronger they will be. Some snowballers use resources with their class. Using resources means while you are doing your turns, you use actions to gain some sort of resource whether its souls, blood, etc. While some actions build up these resources, other actions can use these resources. Snowballers are best suited for players that are the next step above a beginner and wanting a little more complexity into it. While playing a Snowballer, expect for round 1 and maybe even round 2 not being able to do anything significant, but being able to build up to do a lot of damage that can clear the field later.

Classes under the Snowballer Archetype include: The Chef, Reaper, and The Forgotten King.


### Back Stories:

Even before we get ready to type on our keyboards or even start sharpening our pencils, we must first ask ourselves, “What do I want to play?”. We can use inspiration from many different sources while also taking what we learned from **Campaign Philosophy** into account. You should have already had a talk with your GM/D on the style of the campaign you all want to play and about what is expected of you as a player to bring to the table. We should not be writing a completed personal journey for our backstory, but instead building a main character that has yet to fulfill his goals and has some loose ends that need to be tied. 

**[Placeholder for more content, some niche things to cover include healing optional abilities, and exhaustion]**


### Skills/Flaws: 

Skills are a very universal term in the world of TTRPG. In JnJ, skills are unique for the class, player, and their character's backstory. Rarely will you have multiple characters that have the same skill(s). Skills relate to your character. Rather than the normal “Animal handling, Athletics, survival, etc,” JnJ offers you complete creativity and customizable skills that are specific to your character and how you see their strengths. For example, let's say your character is a surgeon. Some of the skills that you might think about are the everyday skills that surgeons might have, like steady hands, calm minded, or medicinal knowledge. Whatever you as a player and your GM/D think makes sense for your character, anything can slide. At the start of your campaign or journey, you will have 4 starting skills unless otherwise stated by your GM. What makes skills important are that they offer plenty of opportunities to achieve a higher level of roleplay and help you play your character better. When a skill should come into play, you have an extra modifier to apply so that skill benefits you.

There are a few “Levels” of skills that you will have access to. There are General skills, Trained skills, Specialized skills, and Ultimate skills. Each level of skill will apply a different modifier to add to skill check rolls. General skills will give a modifier of 2, Trained skills give a modifier of 3, Specialized skills give a modifier of 4, and ultimates give a modifier of 5. A general skill is a skill that you have general knowledge about. Trained skill is a skill that you have had some training in and dabble in. Specialized skill is a skill that you do every single day that you do better than others. Ultimate skills are skills that you are one of the best at. The higher up in the level of skills from general-ultimate, the more niche that skill is. Typically, a player will start out with 2 general skills, 1 trained skill, and 1 specialized skill, as the ultimate skill will come into play at a later date.

On the flip side, there are Flaws. Flaws, just like skills, will also relate to your character's struggles that happen throughout their life. Let's go back to the surgeon's example, some of their flaws may be: Easily burnt out, Cracks under pressure, Emotionless, etc. Flaws come into play if you are in a scenario that would affect your character's flaws. Instead of giving you a positive modifier, it can give you a negative modifier.

Just like the skills, there are also a few different levels of flaws. You have Minor Flaws, Flaws, Major Flaws, and PTSD. Minor Flaws a modifier of 2. Flaws have a modifier of 3. Major Flaws have a modifier of 4. And PTSD has a modifier of 5. The level of flaws will be dictated on what seems to be the most damaging or the most traumatic to your character. The lower trama/damaging being the Minor Flaw while having the most trama/being the most damaging being PTSD. Unless specified by your GM, you will start with one of each Flaw.

Now this is where things can get interesting. Skills and Flaws CAN be used in a positive or negative situation. For example, let's say that one of your skills is Fast hands as your work requires you to be able to use your hands fast. Let's take that skill and throw you in a room where you have to perform surgery and you need to have slow and steady hands. Because you have Fast hands and not steady hands you would make a skill check with a NEGATIVE modifier instead of the normal modifier. Both skills and flaws can be used in the opposite way intended. Skills and Flaws are always asked by the GMs, never the players. They can be activated at any time, whether it be a combat scenario or a rollplay scene. When designing skills and flaws for your characters, they are NOT to be used to min-max. When you min-max, it takes out the fun and creativity of the system.


### Actions/Spells:

Some of the different types of things you can do are called **Actions**. Examples of actions are Basic attacks, Movement, Abilities, Spells, Reactions, Taking cover, etc. More actions will be displayed in different sections of the rules. Actions will always take a certain number of action points to be able to use. Some actions can take 1, some 2, some 3 or more. You and your GM will come up with a number of actions that will fit what you want as a character. Another type of action is a **Free Action**. Free actions are usually class specific that have some sort of action that does NOT use one of your 3 actions. A free action can be combat specific, could be roleplay specific, or could be used as both. **Reactions **are a special type of action that not every character will have. Reactions usually will have a prerequisite that you have to meet in order to activate it. Each round, you can only activate one reaction and it does NOT count against your 3 actions that you use. An example is “Reaction- When an ally misses an attack, you may give them the power to reroll their attack and give them a +1 to hit.”. The next thing is **Spells**. Starting at level one, “You start with 2 spell slots and have a different amount of spells that you have access to.” Not only do spells cost a spell slot, but they also require a certain amount of actions. Just like other actions, spells can cost 1 or more actions. Once you do run out of your two spell slots, you cannot use another spell unless you use a short rest or a long rest. Not only can you choose classes that have predetermined actions and/or spells, but you can also make your own class with your own actions and spells. For this, just ask what actions does your character have? Do they have magic or spells? With your GM, you will talk about some of the different ideas you might have for your character. This may take many ideas to be able to finish, but do not be discouraged. When coming up with your ideas, have the questions: what kind of Archetype am I playing? Do I want to be a melee focus or a range focus? Do I dabble in magic or do I have no magic?


#### Action Types:

Utility vs. Assault Actions:

There are 2 major categories of actions: Utility actions and Assault actions. Both actions can be implemented in both roleplaying outside of combat and inside of combat. Utility actions are actions that oftenly will not deal damage to a target. Some things that a utility action can do is allow an ally to reroll dice, healing a target, putting debuffs on enemies, buffing your allies, being able to push enemies into different zones, etc. These actions allow you to give support to allies. Make sure that you utilize the area, enemies, and allies.

Assault actions usually will deal with damaging an enemy or target. This can be as simple as a basic attack, to using a big powerful ultimate ability.  Most assault actions involve a roll to determine if the action will hit and if how much damage the action will deal. Some of the assault actions will not use a roll to hit, but rather will use a DC check to see if the enemy avoids the attack altogether.


## Passives:

Passives are another unique aspect of a player's class. Not every class will have a passive, but some will. Like most games, a passive ability is something that can be active at all times, and it doesn't cost actions, hero points, or anything else. Some passive abilities, however, do need to meet a requirement to activate the passive. An example is “Whenever you are in the same zone as one other ally, you gain +1 AC”. Some may not need a requirement to have it be activated.


### Race/Ancestry:

Now that we have designed what our Class and Archetype is, now we can finally get to the literal aspects of our character. What do we look like? What is our history and background? Race/Ancestry should be important to our character as it defines the place where we come from. Depending on what you choose for your Race/Ancestry, it can also grant you certain actions unique to the race you picked. These are to give you some more roleplay actions to help you get more immersed into what your identity is. Now, what is stated under the Race/Ancestry is not law, so please work with your GM/D to define what your ancestry is in the world you have created together. You can also talk with them to change the actions races come with if you feel like it doesn't fit with the story you guys are trying to build. Remember, all rules are to increase your familiarity and connection with your character. It is highly encouraged for you to write your own culture and history that your family has experienced. Spending this time to write down how culture has affected your character's back story can add a lot of depth to your character. It can also be how other different cultures have affected your character. Remember not to only focus on negativity during this; positivity can build a lot more than you think it does.

Typically we’ll have a slightly more advanced society due to the mining Culture.


#### Lizardfolks:

A race with anthropomorphic lizards and reptiles, usually characterized with warm toned scales, a long tail, and a snout. Instead of hands, they possess claws that are able to stab and pierce small prey. Most Lizardfolk live to 120 years of age, and mature around 15 years. Lizardfolk tend to live in isolation or in small groups, hunting and foraging for the resources they need. Depending on their native location, they may use a variety of tools, skills, and transportations to help them survive. While many lizardfolk avoid civilization because of their beast-like appearance, there are some lizardfolk that thrive in big cities and towns. Nonetheless, lizardfolk have a certain air around them that makes them unapproachable and unappealing.

Gnolls live up to 100 years, and mature at age 14. While Gnolls are an uncommon sight, they are very charismatic and charming. They possess a distinct ability to persuade, which makes many others wary of their presence. Because of this, many gnolls are hired as hustlers, and they are darn good at it. This does not mean that all gnolls are shifty. Other gnolls return to their domesticated self, being great caregivers or supporters for those in need.


# Combat:

Now that we have a class and character created (hopefully), let’s discuss how you actually play with our system! Our combat is designed so that it can flow as smoothly and quickly between player and enemy turns with little downtime and 4th wall breaking and as much roleplay as possible. As a reference, here is a template of our combat tracker, which will allow both players and Game Masters/Directors (GM/D) to keep track of combat turns.




### General Rules:

One detail you may notice on the tracker is that there are no player initiative and player order. Our system revolves around GM/D setting turn order per round instead of following a set order. This allows combat to feel random and exciting that can’t be achieved from a repetitive turn order. In addition, we simplified distance and range evaluations by replacing spell ranges with **Zones**. We will discuss zones in a later section. When a player takes their turn, they have a total of three action points they can use. This can be used for many different actions, including but not limited to moving, attacking, casting a spell, insulting, chatting, throwing a chair, or even doing the Macarena in the middle of the battlefield. Each spell and attack has their own point value, with some consuming 1 action and other stronger attacks consuming up to 3 actions. While not noted on the combat tracker, some skills and abilities may be free actions, which can be used at any time during your turn. Finally, some skills may be reactions, which can be used when the reaction condition is met.

When attacking multiple times within the same turn, players will receive a penalty to their hit roll, with a minus 5 per additional attack, maxing at minus 10. Agile weapons can reduce this value to a minus 4, while heavy weapons will increase the hit roll to minus 6.

Next, let’s talk about engagement (Congratulations!). When you enter a zone, this does not mean that you become engaged. Only when you attack or get attacked will you enter engagement. Engagement can be between as many allies or enemies there are on the field. If you want to be in a hodge podge, now you can! One specific condition that can be applied during engagement is Flat Footed, which gives the fewer individual party a minus 2 to AC. Leaving engagement may allow for reactions that trigger from leaving engagement, but this must be specified by the enemy or ally skills. Engagement has a unique system called the **Zipper System**, which will also be discussed later.

When an ally goes down, players will roll a straight d20 to determine their fate. A roll of 10 or lower will give one dying and a natural 1 will give two dying. A roll of 11 or higher will lower the dying counter and a natural 20 will bring the ally back up with 1 HP. When an ally is brought back up by healing, they gain Wounded equal to the amount of times they go down. When that ally goes back down, their dying counter starts at the level of Wounded plus 1 they accumulate. When a player’s dying level goes past three, the player will die.

Cover can be given when a player is hidden behind a wall or obstructing mass. When a player takes cover, you gain plus 1 AC when attacked by ranged attacks. When behind cover, you may use an action to choose to hide behind cover, giving you the condition non-visible, plus 2 AC when attacked by ranged attacks. If a player or enemy was never seen behind cover, they receive the hidden tag which gives a 25% chance of not being able to hit them when attacked by ranged attacks.


### Interpreting Everything Else on the Tracker:

Let’s look at everything else on the tracker if you’re following along. Players will be listed under the players section at the top, and NPCs and enemies will be listed on the bottom section. Health points are split into two boxes, one for the max HP and the other for the current HP. When taking damage, you only need to update the current HP. Statuses for each individual and enemy can be noted in the Statuses column. This includes Bloodied, and Critical. One very special condition called Haste will unlock the haste action column, giving players and enemies an extra action. The condition Slowed has the opposite effect, removing the third action for all that are affected. Enemies will have a Dead/KO’d column, which will strike out the name and mark the enemy as dead. Finally, there is a call action which is only to be given by the GM/D. Call actions allow you to call someone on your team at any time during your turn to use one action when they are called to do any action they desire. This can be used as an impactful combo moment, or just to reposition another ally for a zone wide attack if necessary.


### Zones:

Now that we have the base rules and tracker figured out, let’s talk about the drop down at the top of the tracker: the Zones. Instead of measuring distances and asking which enemies might be within your fireball range to nuke, zones allow you to easily identify what enemies (or allies) you can hit with your instakill. Unless specified otherwise, melee hits can attack any enemy within a zone, entering engagement, while ranged hits can attack enemies one zone away without entering engagement. Ranged attacks can also be used one zone additionally, up to two zones away, and the attacker gets a minus 2 to hit rolls. Zones can be moved into by using a move action, and certain skills may allow players or enemies to move into another zone and attack.

Next, how do we determine where a zone is? GM/Ds can create zone maps that define how a battlefield may look. This can be as simple as a linear map with zones 1, 2, and 3 in a line, or create an octagonal ring with 4+ zones for each edge. These maps are to be shared with the players and may include important structures such as obstructions or mechanisms.

On certain maps, there may be zones labeled with M’s. These zones are special zones, which may include alternate dimensions, hidden zones, or obstructed zones that are not meant to be entered without special means. These zones may also include moving zones, such as moving platforms, which can have different properties based on GM/D discretion.

**[Dynamic Zones to be done by Jonah]**


### Zipper System:

Whew, still here? Let’s talk about one of our unique systems, the Zipper system. In our system, we wanted combat to be realistic and fun, where players and enemies get the opportunity to retaliate, especially on a miss. Thus, the Zipper System was born. During engagement, when an ally or enemy misses, Zipper will trigger, causing the one who was attacked to move next, regardless of how many actions the attacker used or whoever the GM/D wanted to go next. This allows for quick retaliation and snarky remarks towards the attacker followed by their own attacks. Zippers can trigger many times between two or more individuals, as long as they keep missing each other. This means that this can lead to a funny scene with a player and enemy constantly missing each other while insulting each other constantly on how bad their aim is. Zipper ends if the individual delays, chooses not to act, or runs out of actions, and the turn order goes back to the original player or enemy turn, given that they still have actions.


### Tempo System:

There are 4 tempos that combat may revolve around. The quickest tempo is tempo 0, where combat has no action economy, turn order, and is meant to be finished within 5-10 minutes. Actions should be rapid fire and quick, lasting no longer than 15 seconds. All actions must be in roleplay format, with virtually no 4th wall breaks. Tempo 1 is a less intense, but still fast paced combat scenario where attacks are still fully narrated, but allows for more thought and strategy. Zones will help with fast flow and progression, and roleplay should be high throughout, including but not limited to insults, remarks, banter, etc. Tempo 2 is a slower Tempo 1, where roleplay and narration may be set aside to focus more on combat and strategy. Each turn may take a bit longer to plan out, and questions may be asked during player turns. Finally, Tempo 3 is a full non-roleplay non-immersive combat where all distances, grids, and ranges can be considered. All of combat will be focused on player strategy, where no character interaction or roleplay is present.

When it comes to tempos 1-3, all dice are rolled as normal, and all rules for combat apply. Tempos can be switched during combat, especially if combat flow is better or worse than expected. In tempo 0, the intention is to be very cinematic and intense, often led to from tempo 1 or outside of combat. Due to the quick paced nature and 100% immersion of roleplay, a special rule set must be applied to ensure the fast paced combat. First, no dice are rolled during tempo 0. It is fully up to the leading GM/D’s discretion whether an attack hits or misses.

Additionally, there are unique hand gestures that eliminate the need for vocal turn order, which requires players and GM/Ds to pay attention to. It is advised that each player recognizes and understands each hand symbol. Each player should have an unique symbol that indicates they will be acting next after another person’s turn. An open palm hand (resembling a stop sign) indicates that the GM/D is narrating. If another GM/D is present, they will also have an unique symbol for NPC actions. **[Add more]**

Don’t worry if your first run is not perfect! You are alway welcome to redo tempo 0 if a certain scenario is not desired or an outcome turned out terribly. We understand that this is a hard tempo to pull off, which means that errors and mistakes will happen, just take your time and do the best you can. This is meant to be a spontaneous orchestrated fight, which means that it will take your best effort.

Songs may be used, and are encouraged, for all tempos, though it is ultimately up to the GM/D. These tempos will work as well as how much effort you decide to put into it! Low effort will lead to a low effort combat. Make sure that you plan out your encounters to go as smoothly as possible without making it seem forced.


### Interception:

Interception can be done by any character as a reaction. A player can intercept another person when moving from their zone to another zone. Using a reaction, the intercepted individual will automatically engage with the interceptor, and must make their attack against them if they were intending to. Alternatively, they may choose to disengage, which uses their action. If any movement action was attempted, the movement gets canceled and the action is consumed.


### Attack Continuity System:

Another simple, yet effective system we have in place is the Attack Continuity System. When players want to attack with their skill or weapon, we don’t want to limit their creativity, especially if they want to do something cool or unique without questioning how much damage this would really do. The Attack Continuity System allows players to flavor an attack however they want in whatever way they want without worrying about damage changes and whether they can do it or not. This means that attacks such as sword slashes or fireballs are not limited to such slashing or firing. Sword slashes can be slashing a rope that causes a fixture to fall that does equal damage, or fireballs blowing holes in the ceiling, causing small rocks to fall. GM/Ds are welcome to alter effects slightly if desired, as long as it is within reason.


### Roleplay:

Now let’s get into the juicy part of our combat, the Roleplay potential. Our simplifications to the TTRPG combat allows for fast and fluent combat turns that are filled with action and suspense. There should be as little player to player communication and as much character roleplay as possible. This means acting out or describing what your character is doing while trying to keep asking the GM/D as little questions as possible. In roleplay, everything (within reason) is fair game! Chat with another party member, insult and berate the enemy, flavor your actions as much as you want! A simple sword slash does not have to be just a slash. Come up with your own flair to attack, such as ramming the hilt into the enemy’s chest, or do a war cry that boosts your character’s morale. Heck, maybe the GM/D will give you a **Hero Point **if you do it well enough. Fist punches can be using pocket sand or a sucker punch. Do whatever you think your character would do in that moment, and don’t let your skill descriptions limit you on what you do or say. Create combat lines beforehand to keep flow going and preplan what you want to do or say before your turn comes up so that you are ready once it does. Remember, we want to keep downtime low and immersion high, so wing it if you have to! Even if you do something stupid, such as sacrificing yourself to a swarm of scarabs from a mummy king while the other players watch, the scene becomes more eventful, suspenseful, or just outright funny. As long as all players are having a fun time with your roleplay, then do as your heart's content.
